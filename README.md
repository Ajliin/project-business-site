## The problem
problem has to be solved in three parts, which are all new to me so I have to study each part
Overview:
If I had more time I would maybe change the main content from grid to flexbox. I struggle the most with how it the webpage change when resizing. Mybe I use vh (viewport height) to much? But I need to find some "rules" for which heights and line spaces is needed in diffent quieres.

1. I will make a hero-videdo. I wont be able to find different sizes, but I will prepare to but differnt sizes in, depending om @media queriy.

 My biggest problem were fixing the header in the center. When I had the parent as position relative I fixed to solve the problem.

2. Sign up form 
I coded along with the video from Technigo. Try to style them a bit fanicer, but didnt have time to fix the default setting (where as the blue checkbox)

3. Use CSS to show and hide content - and toogle function in Java
JavaScript I also follwed wednsday lesson and talking with team. It is still a bit tricky, looking forward to practise it.
