## The problem
problem has to be solved in three parts, which are all new to me so I have to study each part


1. I will start with a image and if there is time I will add a video somewhere else in page - pictures on unsplash
Use media queries and display:none if wanted

2. Sign up form - try from video

3. Use CSS to show and hide content - and toogle function in Java
"The JavaScript file is set up to add toggle an ".active" class on the title divs when you click the title (use the inspector to see this in action). Use an "adjacent" CSS selector to select the panel next to an ".active" element and set it to display: block; to make it visible. Read this to learn about the adjacent selector."


Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
